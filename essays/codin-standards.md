# Standards, Standards, Standards
From OSHA to Google, there are standards to follow, which keep people safe in the physical and digital worlds. With safety and security, things also need to be consistent, especially in group and professional settings. With coding standards, almost anyone can look at your code and understand it. Starting from a better place would elevate the rest of the code. 

When I started programming in high school, all I was required to do was to get the correct result while sometimes implementing certain functions or loops. I had the freedom to hardcode anything that I wanted. We didn't have any group projects in that class, we only needed minimal comments to explain to the teacher what each part did. But now that I have done projects with other people, I realize how important having comments is and that people have very different ways to write like naming conventions and such.

# Standards are Helpful
When I first started to use ESLint, I thought the errors were very trivial and shouldn't matter. Errors like: 
- Closing curly brace does not appear on the same line as the subsequent block
- Trailing Spaces
- Expected indentation of 2 spaces but found

But when I fixed these errors, I made a realization. ESLint and coding standards are to help programmers develop better habits for writing code. Especially as I am still new to Javascript and Typescript, it is helpful to catch errors in a language I am not very familiar with. Compared to others, Typescript as a language aims to have this sort of standard to help developers clearly define everything so others can look back on it and understand. I think that ESLint will help me develop my skills in Typescript and programming as a whole. 

# The Standard
In the end, coding standards are very useful as the world continues to become more digital. With so many devices and programs out there, a standard would help any programmer to understand the code, to fix bugs, and add onto pre-existing code. With a high level of consistency, developers across the world can work more efficiently and effectively. Using a coding standard can achieve a higher rate of getting help when a problem occurs. The standard will make the world run faster while taking less space.
