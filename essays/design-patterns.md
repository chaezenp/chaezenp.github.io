# How can a question be 'smart'?
When you ask a question, the person you're asking may or may not have an answer. If they happen to have an answer, it may not be the one you're looking for. There are many reasons why that may be, but you have to ask another question. One to yourself, "Was it a **smart** question?". Yes, there is "no such thing as a *dumb* question" but, like baking, you need details, you need measurements. This is especially true in software engineering. A vague question may get you an acceptable answer but more often than not, you won't. That is why an educated smart question must be asked. 

At its core, a smart question stems from a good sense of communication. Can you clearly and specifically ask the question? Get your point across effectively? You can't get help if you don't communicate it properly. In the realm of programming and software engineering, problems can be very technical, so you must be detailed in your questions. And in this case, the internet is your friend. There were many times when a simple Google search found the exact solution that I needed. Other times the solutions were similar but needed some adjustments. Then sometimes none at all. But that is why you research first to not be redundant. Then along with your question, you talk about what you've tried, found success in, and where you got stuck. This will give everyone who comes across the question the tools necessary to help you.
