# How is AI used?
As the years go by, people will continue to arrive at problems that block their path. But if you're lucky, someone out in the world has come to this problem before (and hopefully found a solution). Especially nowadays with the internet, these solutions from the past are archived and much more accessible. And sometimes you may have a semi-specific problem, but you still manage to find a solution while not exact still works. In software development, more often than not, people will face problems with code. This can be remedied with Design Patterns, which are general, well-tested solutions to common problems many face in software development. They serve as blueprints to create reusable and maintainable code. Using Design Patterns allows developers to work more efficiently, as they don't have to reinvent the wheel, while allowing flexibility to modify if needed. Using Design Patterns is very useful in a team setting. It can effectively communicate how you wrote a piece of software while not explicitly stating it. 


# Patterns Are Useful
Design Patterns come in three types: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.
Creational: Focuses on the process or challenges of object creation and how to instantiate objects flexibly and efficiently.
Structural: Focuses on the organization and composition of classes and objects to create larger structures while ensuring flexibility and scalability.
Behavioral: Focuses on the communication and interaction between objects, managing how they collaborate and share responsibilities.
The best way to demonstrate how useful Design Patterns are is to use examples.

When developing [Harmony Quest](https://chaezenp.github.io/projects/harmonyquest.html) and [The Night March](https://chaezenp.github.io/projects/night-march.html), I used at least one of each type of Design Pattern.
