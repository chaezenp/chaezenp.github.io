# I. Introduction
Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has been on the rise in education for better or worse. On the one hand, it can be incredibly beneficial to students and educators as AI can be used to enhance learning in a way that is easier to learn. On the other hand, it is a tool to get out of work and education, as "the AI can do it for me". In turn, teachers alike either try to ban it (and have safeguards to detect its use) or try to integrate it into their classes. It is quite a double-edged sword. 

In the context of software engineering and programming in general, AI has become a prominent tool used by developers to make their lives easier. But more often than not, people use AI to do all the work and devolve into refining their prompts until the answer is satisfactory. Though many can agree that writing code is boring and often monotonous, letting AI do all the work will lead to mediocre code and a misunderstanding of the code. I paraphrase what my Algorithms professor has said again and again, "If you use AI for all your work, why would companies hire you? They can save money and use the AI to do your job."

Though there are numerous positions to be an AI prompt engineer, developing your skills will be beneficial in the long run.

# II. Personal Experience with AI
My personal experience using generative AI, such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini (AI Overview when searching a question), has led me to some great answers that furthered my understanding of a topic. Yet most times it needed to be refined, otherwise the answer was completely wrong or not what I wanted. In my software engineering class, I had my fair share of using AI to help me with assignments and understand how to use programs and topics. Though I put effort into learning first, some topics didn't seem to click with me. And most times when I resorted to using AI, it was when I was in a time crunch. These two played hand-in-hand with my software engineering course's "workouts of the day" or WODs, which are timed exercises to practice the skills previously learnt. 
### 1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
  
### 2. In-class Practice WODs

### 3. In-class WODs

### 4. Essays

### 5. Final project

### 6. Learning a concept / tutorial
  When we first started to use Databases (PostgreSQL), the installation process was confusing, as the guide first presented us with the source code installation

### 7. Answering a question in class or in Discord

### 8. Asking or answering a smart-question

### 9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”

### 10. Explaining code

### 11. Writing code

### 12. Documenting code

### 13. Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”

### 14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed

# III. Impact on Learning and Understanding

# IV. Practical Applications

# V. Challenges and Opportunities

# VI. Comparative Analysis

# VII. Future Considerations

# VIII. Conclusion
People went from "just google it" to "Let me ask ChatGPT" in which the former could've given better results.
