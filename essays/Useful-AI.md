# I. Introduction
Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has been on the rise in education for better or worse. On the one hand, it can be incredibly beneficial to students and educators as AI can be used to enhance learning in a way that is easier to learn. On the other hand, it is a tool to get out of work and education, as "the AI can do it for me". In turn, teachers alike either try to ban it (and have safeguards to detect its use) or try to integrate it into their classes. It is quite a double-edged sword. 

In the context of software engineering and programming in general, AI has become a prominent tool used by developers to make their lives easier. But more often than not, people use AI to do all the work and devolve into refining their prompts until the answer is satisfactory. Though many can agree that writing code is boring and often monotonous, letting AI do all the work will lead to mediocre code and a misunderstanding of the code. I paraphrase what my Algorithms professor has said again and again, "If you use AI for all your work, why would companies hire you? They can save money and use the AI to do your job."

Though there are numerous positions to be an AI prompt engineer, developing your skills will be beneficial in the long run.

# II. Personal Experience with AI
My personal experience using generative AI, such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini (AI Overview when searching a question), has led me to some great answers that furthered my understanding of a topic. Yet most times it needed to be refined, otherwise the answer was completely wrong or not what I wanted. In my software engineering class, I had my fair share of using AI to help me with assignments and understand how to use programs and topics. Though I put effort into learning first, some topics didn't seem to click with me. And most times when I resorted to using AI, it was when I was in a time crunch. These two played hand-in-hand with my software engineering course's "workouts of the day" or WODs, which are timed exercises to practice the skills previously learnt. 
### 1. Experience WODs
  These WODs are homework assignments that focus on software engineering concepts. Since they were homework, the timed portion was more so to get you familiar with the concepts so you can complete it in "Av" or "expert" time. We could attempt these as many times as we wanted and were provided a professor's solution (what the expert time is based on). So **I rarely used AI** for these WODs as I had documentation and the professor's solution to refer to. 
  
### 2. In-class Practice WODs
  As the name suggests, these are practice WODs that are a bit higher stakes than the homework WODs, as you only get one attempt, but trying would get you full credit for the assignment. As these are practice for the "actual" in-class WODs, **I tended to not use AI** because I wanted to push myself, to hone my skills, and learn from what I missed so I could do better on the "actual" WODs. 
  
### 3. In-class WODs
  These were the most stress-inducing of the three different WODs, as these were graded. I do not handle time pressure well, so while **I did use AI** for these WODs, I tried first until Av time was done. For the first few, I did not use AI because I was stubborn not to use it, but as I continued to get "did not finish" times, I used AI to complete WODs fully. I used ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot (the extension version in Visual Studio Code), and Google Gemini (as it's the first thing that shows up in Google search for most code-related questions). An example of a prompt I asked ChatGPT was "[a snippet of code I had so far] how to make text in the center of the middle section," in which it gave me the modified code, where I took a second to read the modified section and after I understood why it was that way I implemented it. Yet sometimes the modified code generated doesn't meet the specifications of the WOD such as 
  
### 4. Essays
  Outside of Grammarly (and sometimes ChatGPT because I don't have Grammarly premium) for grammar, word choice, and spelling, **I have not used AI** to write essays because I feel it would not capture my voice. In past classes, I used AI to outline essays but never write them. In software engineering, the essays written don't need to follow a traditional English paper, so it adds more to the reason not to use AI. Essays in software engineering tend to be reflections, and AI can't truly reflect your opinion. 
  
### 5. Final project
  **I have used AI** for the final project (a fully deployed website using Vercel, Supabase, and a NextJS template), for guidance on implementing certain functions. My project revolved around a website for making new friends on our college campus with a random cycle of profiles. At first, I followed past WODs and assignments as a guide to creating a profile card and layout of the page to connect with others, but I had trouble linking it with my teammate's database format. What originally was four components became six because of the suggestions from ChatGPT. Originally, the "Match" and "Skip" buttons were all handled in the `page.tsx`, the website's connect page file. But the better implementation suggested was to split the button functions up into two more components so that `page.tsx` could just import them along with the other components. 
  
### 6. Learning a Concept/Tutorial
  **I have used AI** (ChatGPT) to explain concepts and topics to me when I was confused. For example, when we first started to use Databases (PostgreSQL), the installation process was confusing, as the guide first presented us with the source code installation instead of the package installer. Fast forward a bit after everything was installed, some commands, like creating a database, in the terminal did not work for me, and when I reinstalled, I had the same problems. So I used AI to look for alternative ways to get the same result with different commands. It led me to use the SQL shell, which came with the PostgreSQL installation, and had different commands, but I managed to achieve the result for my assignments. 

### 7. Answering a Question in Class or in Discord
** I have not used AI** to answer a question because I often am the one with questions in which someone had already asked in discord already. 

### 8. Asking or Answering a Smart-Question
** I have not used AI ** to ask a Smart question because it is redundant to ask AI to create a question in which myself or the AI could answer. Neither have I used it to answer smart questions as 

### 9. Coding Example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”


### 10. Explaining Code
When using a template or learning new syntax or functions, **I have partially used AI** to explain code.


### 11. Writing Code

### 12. Documenting Code

### 13. Quality Assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”

### 14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed

# III. Impact on Learning and Understanding

# IV. Practical Applications

# V. Challenges and Opportunities

# VI. Comparative Analysis

# VII. Future Considerations

# VIII. Conclusion
People went from "just google it" to "Let me ask ChatGPT" in which the former could've given better results.
