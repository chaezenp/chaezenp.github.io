# Introduction
Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has been on the rise in education for better or worse. On the one hand, it can be incredibly beneficial to students and educators as AI can be used to enhance learning in a way that is easier to learn. On the other hand, it is a tool to get out of work and education, as "the AI can do it for me". In turn, teachers alike either try to ban it (and have safeguards to detect its use) or try to integrate it into their classes. It is quite a double-edged sword. My personal experience using generative AI, such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini (AI Overview when searching a question), has led me to some great answers that furthered my understanding of a topic. Yet most times it needed to be refined, otherwise the answer was completely wrong or not what I wanted. So I will be focusing on Software Engineering, a class that allows the use of AI, but you have to declare if AI was used. In Software Engineering, AI can be used as a very good tool to automate tedious and repetitive work, in which you can focus on more complex functions.

# Personal Experience with AI

## 1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
  
## 2. In-class Practice WODs

## 3. In-class WODs

## 4. Essays

## 5. Final project

## 6. Learning a concept / tutorial
  When we first started to use Databases (PostgreSQL), the installation process was confusing, as the guide first presented us with the source code installation

## 7. Answering a question in class or in Discord

## 8. Asking or answering a smart-question

## 9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”

## 10. Explaining code

## 11. Writing code

## 12. Documenting code

## 13. Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”

## 14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed

# Impact on Learning and Understanding

# Practical Applications

# Challenges and Opportunities

# Comparative Analysis

# Future Considerations

# Conclusion
People went from "just google it" to "Let me ask ChatGPT" in which the former could've given better results.
