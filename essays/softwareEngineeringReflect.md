Throughout my software engineering course, I have gained a lot more knowledge about programming concepts, methods, and other tools to help development. While most assignments focused on web development, the core of this class was to *think* like a software engineer, to use what we have learned on future projects beyond web applications and front-end development. I have gained a greater appreciation for the **standards I hold for myself in my work, the patterns I can utilize to develop more efficiently, and functional programming to expedite my ventures.**

# Coding Standards


# Functional Programming


# Design Patterns


# Conclusion
