Throughout my software engineering course, I have gained much more knowledge about programming concepts, methods, and other tools to help development. While most assignments focused on web development, the core of this class was to *think* like a software engineer, to use what we have learned on future projects beyond web applications and front-end development. I have gained a greater appreciation for the **standards I hold for myself in my work, the patterns I can utilize to develop more efficiently, and functional programming to expedite my development.**

# Structure: Coding Standards
When I first started this class, my code documentation was standard. I commented on the main aspects of the code, only going into detail about functions that were not intuitive. I just commented enough to get a good grade, with a previous class that required comments couldn't be more than 80 characters long (indentation included). Now that I have used ``ESLint``, a code analysis tool for JavaScript, and its extension ``Prettier ESLint`` (more formatting) as the coding standard in my software engineering course, I see how much it has made my code visually appealing and error-free. ESLint is also a great tool for learning JavaScript and TypeScript syntax, as it catches all types of errors. And with ``Prettier`` in your integrated development environment (IDE), you can have it automatically format your code as you write to save the hassle at the end. 

Using this coding standard has shown me how important having a structure is. Not only does it result in having clean code, but it also results in having code that is easier to debug, maintain, and update, especially by others. Having this structure leads to others understanding it better. The formatting, naming conventions, and consistent logic can be shared throughout a project, leading to an efficient workflow among teams in which reduces the misunderstandings and errors that could have happened previously. It's also good practice for future developers who need to update or modify the program. 

Having a defined structure for a collaborative setting is a must to keep everything organized and well-maintained. Using and maintaining a consistent structure reinforces the habit of noticing inconsistencies while writing code, and it forces you into a discipline that will help you be more focused, consistent, and organized. 


# Blueprints: Design Patterns
As coding standards are used to reduce headaches in the format and readability of the code, design patterns are used to reduce headaches in defining and solving problems. Design patterns are general, well-tested solutions to common problems many face in software development. It's not the direct solution, but it provides the blueprints to start building one and is not tied to any specific coding language or application.

While building [Manoa Connect](https://chaezenp.github.io/projects/Manoa-Connect.html), we utilized the **Builder Pattern** for account creation and modification as the profiles all have unique information but still share the same components. Then I used **State Pattern** for determining whether another user should be presented on the connect page, in other words, if you have already matched or liked a profile, it won't show up in the connect page again.

Just like using a coding standard, applying a design pattern provides structure and keeps everyone on the team on the same page. It sets up expectations of how the component of the project should behave. Using these patterns isn't just for web development, but can be used for a multitude of systems, like in game development (which I have), desktop applications, or robotics software. 

I think the concept of design patterns is very powerful as it can be used in a wide variety of professions. It promotes a method of problem-solving that uses solutions that can be reused and repurposed to fit the challenge at hand. It guides decision making, can streamline efforts, and promotes modular thinking. Design patterns is a useful tool for creating flexible approaches to problems without having to reinvent the wheel.
