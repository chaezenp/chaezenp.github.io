During each summer, Gameheads students create teams among themselves to create a game over the summer with a core idea shared by each team member. In our ideation process, we agreed on the central idea of harmony as in "the world lives in harmony. From there, we started to develop concepts of a game revolving around music to utilize the double meaning of "harmony".

For this project, we used Unity to develop this game. I was the lead programmer who was responsible for programming the various game mechanics and developing the UI functions. I started with the basics of movement and jumping. I developed the musical and color-changing platforms that trigger when jumped on by the player. Next, I started on a core mechanic of switching between the different notes as each had a unique trait such as jumping higher or moving faster. Then I programmed the grabbing mechanic to pick up boxes on certain levels. Besides movement, I programmed each additional mechanic, such as switching characters, into a controller input.
