# Purpose
To facilitate student connection, Manoa Connect is a social networking website that matches students together, using a similar functionality to dating apps (Tinder, Hinge, etc.), across the UH Manoa campus. Despite the thousands of students on the UH Manoa campus, some students have a hard time making friends outside of their (ongoing/previous) classes or majors, whether it be incoming freshmen, exchange students, those with a more introverted personality, or difficulty breaking into established friend groups. On top of that, the pandemic and lockdown have led many to prefer socializing online to offline.  

By creating a social platform distinct to members of UH Manoa, we hope students can:

- Develop friendships with people from different majors at UH Manoa to learn new perspectives
- Find new career/networking opportunities by connecting with students in different fields of study
- Learn how to socialize with people who have unique backgrounds, gaining social skills applicable throughout life

Manoa Connect is designed, implemented, and maintained by Aaron Ramos, Codie Nakamura, Masaki Sakai, and myself, Chaezen-Lee Pebria.

# Design 

The core of the website includes a *profile*, *chat*, and *match* page. There is also a page for new users to create an account and pages to custimize your profile such as adding photos or your current class schedule.

# Contributions

Originally, I was only going to use it for a list of all previous classes some had took, but I realized it could be reused for other types of lists like a users interests and likes (but the final version of the project reworked the UX/UI, not requiring it).
