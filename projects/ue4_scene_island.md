Through Gameheads I learned Blender and Unreal Engine 4. Utilizing the free assets in the Unreal store, I created a scene of a floating island with an ancient tower that has since been overgrown. The story goes that the crystals have magical properties that allow the surrounding land to float into the air. 

When I got these free assets, the bottom of them were open. To fix this I duplicated the rocks and flipped them and grouped them together to make a full rock.
